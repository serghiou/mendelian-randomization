# Mendelian Randomization

<div align="justify">

A repository on resources about Mendelian Randomization.

## Overview

We will be talking about MR, its risks (e.g. difference between horizontal and vertical pleiotropy and the methods to correct for this statistically), a few subtle points (e.g. the closer the exposure is to the gene (e.g. DNA, RNA, protein) the more protected you are from pleiotropy) and a few recent advancements (e.g. bidirectional MR when exposure and outcome can be both).
